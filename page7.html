Kraken, if you kill it, the enemies turret will rendered unusable to easily destroying it.<br>

  Onmyoji differs from any others MOBA game:<br>

<span style='font-size:25px;'>&#8226;</span> First from the graphics, it wins than the other.<br>

<span style='font-size:25px;'>&#8226;</span> The graphic is so cool and smooth, with a Japan setting making it so cute and anime like.<br>

<span style='font-size:25px;'>&#8226;</span> The other is the gameplay, although the game is the same as any other MOBA game, it differs in its jungle system. In this game, Jungle monster EXP can’t be shared with one another. Well, another is probably the imbalance heroes.<br>

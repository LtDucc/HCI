	<p>My intended audience for this tutorial is beginner programmers. You’ll learn about frustration-free debugging with chrome dev tools.<br>

Dear Beginner, a while ago, I was where you are! After a lot of struggles, I feel like I have come far in my learning journey. I am currently in the senior phase of an immersive bootcamp where I am building full stack applications.<br>

Every day, I learn and stumble upon so many things, which I wished I knew before. This article is an attempt to share one such idea that will make your life easier.<br>

As you must have learned, the best way to learn programming is by doing. Now, as you start practicing coding, sometimes (or most of the times) your code will not work; in other words, there will be a BUG in your code. And you may have already tried and learned some approaches to debugging. This article is not about any one debugging approach, but rather a setup to debug your code for programming practice.<br>

If you are practicing on an online development environment, most probably you have a setup where you have an editor, a problem and a test suite that tests your program.<br>

You have written code, and there are some bugs, and at some point, the errors thrown up by the test suite are not really helpful.<br>

I won’t elaborate on how tedious debugging can become here — rather let me jump straight to some tips for beginners.<br>

<strong>The problem</strong><br>
As an example, I am writing a palindrome checker in FreeCodeCamp’s editor. My solution fails. In this case, we could use the test suite results to debug.<br>

But let’s assume this test suite doesn’t give me great pointers to the exact error. (This may not be the ideal example in terms of a logical error. The point is you will come across problems where the test suite will not directly point to a logical error.)<br>

<strong>Tip: Use the console of developer tools.</strong><br>
I run the same code in the console with the failing test case, and I see it returns ‘undefined’. That means the code did not return any value. I can quickly see that I forgot to return ‘true ’ if the string was found to be a palindrome.<br>
<img src="img/a3.jpg" class="a"><br>
This was a very simple error. Most of the times you would have bugs that need you to examine your variables. One approach to check variables is to <i><b>console.log(variables)</b></i> in the program.<br>

However, I would suggest you use the <i><b>dev tools debugger</b></i> instead. In your program, you can specify the point where you want to start getting help from the debugger.<br>
<img src="img/a4.jpg" class="a"><br>
The debugger will show you all the variables in the call stack and let you step through function calls, which you will find very useful.<br>
<img src="img/a5.jpg" class="a"><br>
You will get the hang of using the debugger once you have used it a few times. Notice the arrows in the lower left box? These will let you control the program flow and show you the variables as they change.<br>

Now let’s head for a trick.<br>
<strong>Trick: Make a Personal Debugging Setup</strong><br>
As seen above, with debugger and console, we can identify the problems easily. However, if I want to run the corrected program again on the console with just one line of change, I would have to re-type it.<br>

Even after that, I get an error:<br>
<img src="img/a6.jpg" class="a"><br>
This error is because I have used an arrow function, and cannot re-declare a const. This means that I would have to open a new tab and new console every time I change my code. Extra overhead, right?<br>

Let's find a workaround. On your system, create a directory and cd into that directory.<br>

Now create two files: index.js and index.html. Type the following HTML in index.html:<br>
<img src="img/a7.jpg" class="a"><br>
Now move your code from the console to index.js. Notice I have started the debugger on line 2 in the code.<br>
<img src="img/a8.jpg" class="a"><br>
Now run the index.html file in the browser. Open the developer tools or console (you may have to refresh to see the debugger). You can debug your code here.<br>
<img src="img/a9.jpg" class="a"><br>
Now every time you make a change to index.js you just hit refresh on this tab and the code reruns. No need to close and open tabs, no re-typing whole programs.<br>

Keep the folder you just created handy. Whenever you need to try or debug a piece of code, pop that into index.js and experiment!!<br>
<strong>Closing thoughts</strong><br>
If you already knew this, congratulations you wasted a valuable 4 minutes ;)<br>

Finally, remember to <i>err is human</i>! Don’t worry about bugs — they will teach you the most valuable lessons of programming… and then ... <i>Oh! the places you’ll go<i>…<br>

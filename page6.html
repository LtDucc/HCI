  <strong>Online Gambling Evolution</strong><br><br>
Over the last few years, software companies such as <a href="https://choicecasinos.com/online-slots/playson/">Slots by Playson</a> have come up with a new innovative way to play slot machines. Mobile gambling has grown into the most important sector in the industry and companies such as Playson have focused their efforts on this ever-growing sector. Now it is more vital than ever before that an online casino is able to work perfectly on all devices due to the wide range of products such as Tablets and Smartphones that players use to access gambling websites.<br>

Over the last decade, the worldâ€™s largest gaming companies such as PlayStation and Xbox have heavily invested in creating virtual gaming technology. We are now starting to see the results and over the new few years we should see a switch from 3D graphics to virtual worlds and augmented reality.

In the online casino and gambling sector, the creation of virtual worlds allows for endless possibilities and will take this form of entertainment to the next level. By 2020 the prices of this form of technology will have dramatically come down in price which will enable it to become mainstream. Instead of been sat down playing games on a desktop PC or mobile games on the go, players will be transported to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world">VR worlds</a> with voice and gesture control.<br><br>
    <strong>The Blockchain And Online Gambling</strong><br><br>
  Blockchain technology is going to have one of the largest impacts the gambling industry has ever seen. The old casino business model of requiring a house edge to make a profit is going to be eliminated by crypto running programs using smart contracts to execute them. Instead, the profits will be generated via the price of the platforms crypto rising in value.<br>
